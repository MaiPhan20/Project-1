# SPEEDRACER or STREETRACING

## What is SPEEDRACER or STREETRACING?
**speed racer**
(Brief description of the game, why you're choosing to make it)
Speedracer is basically a racing game where 2 players race each other for VICTORY!!.
reason i chose this game is because i have an idea of how to do them and also because i love racing games!!!!

## Wireframe
on paper .

## Initial thoughts on game structure
**Speedracer:**
I was thinking on doing key codes for the cars in the race. whenever a car goes past the finish line, an image of the racer will pop out.
Also i want to use keyframes to make the cars look like they are actually running.

(Write out what challenges you expect to encounter, or ideas you want to come up with)
**Speedracer**
challenges i will think would be between the keycodes, keyframes and actually making the car go past the finish line.

## Phases of Completion
when one racer wins, a pop up of the racer will show up saying he won the race.

(The steps or phases you expect to go through, and the tasks that you'll need to accomplish to reach each step. These should resemble the acceptance criteria we were working through earlier.)
