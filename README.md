# SPEEDRACER or STREETRACER

## What is SPEEDRACER or STREETRACER

Speedracer is basically a racing game where 2 players race each other for VICTORY!!.
Reason i chose this game is because i have an idea of how to do them and also because i love racing games!!!!

## Wireframe
on paper .

## Initial thoughts on game structure

I was thinking on doing key codes for the cars in the race. whenever a car goes past the finish line, an image of the racer will pop out.
Also i want to use keyframes to make the cars look like they are actually running.
To make the car reach the end point i was planning on relying the winner on reaching 
the finish line with actual pixels.
Challenges i will think would be between the keycodes, keyframes and actually making the car go past the finish line.
 Also trying to make like a landing page for the game and trying to actually make the background
 image repeat somehow.

## Phases of Completion
when one racer wins, a pop up of the racer will show up saying he won the race.

 day 1: pesudocode + html

 I learned how to call an element from css by calling it with the offset for a collition. I found this method here:

HOW TO PLAY:

Press "S" to move player 1 forwards and use keys "W" and "X" to move up and down.
Press "J" to move player 2 forwards and use keys "U"  and "M"  to move up and down.
Avoid the incoming cars to win the race!


Used  Javascript / HTML and CSS.
